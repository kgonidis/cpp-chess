## Overview

The ChessEngine library is a comprehensive chess engine designed to facilitate the development of chess applications. It provides a robust set of features for handling chess game logic, move generation, and game state management. The library is written in C++ and includes support for both C and C++ interfaces.

## Features

- **Game State Management**: Manage the state of a chess game, including piece positions, castling rights, en passant squares, and more.
- **Move Generation**: Generate legal moves for all pieces, including special moves like castling and en passant.
- **PGN Parsing**: Parse and generate Portable Game Notation (PGN) for recording and replaying chess games.
- **Bitboard Representation**: Efficiently represent the chessboard and pieces using bitboards.
- **Zobrist Hashing**: Use Zobrist hashing for fast game state comparison and transposition table implementation.
- **Attack Patterns**: Precompute and store attack patterns for all pieces to speed up move generation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler
- CMake
- Git

### Building the Library

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone --recurse-submodules <repository_url>
   ```

2. Create a build directory and navigate to it:
   ```sh
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

3. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```sh
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```sh
   cmake --build .
   ```

### Running the Engine

To run the chess engine, use the following command:

```sh
./chessengine <path_to_pgn_file>
```

If no PGN file is provided, the engine will use a default file `e4NYStyle.pgn`.

### iOS Build

To build the project for iOS, use the `build_ios.sh` script:

```sh
./build_ios.sh
```
